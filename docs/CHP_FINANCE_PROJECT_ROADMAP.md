# CHP Finance Project Roadmap

## Purpose

This document translates the current finance opportunity set into a **CHP-hardened implementation roadmap**.

CHP matters here because these are not just analytics workflows. They are decision workflows where:

- assumptions should be surfaced before they are trusted
- partner critique should happen before narrative lock
- third-party validation should exist before final board or CFO use

## Ranking Method

Projects are ranked using:

- **ROI speed**: how quickly the workflow can generate finance value
- **Decision criticality**: how expensive false consensus would be
- **Data readiness**: how close the inputs already are to an MVP
- **CHP fit**: how naturally the workflow benefits from hardening, lock states, and validation

Scale:

- Effort: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`
- Impact: `Medium`, `High`, `Very High`
- CHP Fit: `Medium`, `High`, `Very High`

## Recommended Build Waves

### Wave 1: Fastest ROI

1. Monthly CFO Variance Studio
2. 13-Week Cash Forecast Engine
3. Board Reporting Generator

Why this wave:

- clear data shape
- immediate finance team value
- visible outputs for CFO, CEO, and board
- strong CHP use because narrative lock matters

### Wave 2: Operating Control

4. AP Cash & Payables Optimizer
5. 24-Month SaaS Operating Model
6. CFO Decision Impact Simulator

Why this wave:

- extends from reporting into planning and cash control
- high day-to-day decision usefulness
- pushes CHP from narrative hardening into policy and scenario hardening

### Wave 3: Platform Expansion

7. SaaS KPI Dashboard
8. Investment Committee Scoring Tool
9. SEC / Earnings / Company Research Workbench
10. Multi-Agent CFO Operating System

Why this wave:

- broadens the surface area
- turns individual workflows into an integrated system
- creates the strongest long-term moat

## CHP Hardening Pattern by Project

All ten projects should use the same hardening pattern:

### Phase 0: Foundation

Purpose:

- identify weak assumptions
- surface invalidation conditions
- expose the key vulnerability

Examples:

- Variance Studio: are the top drivers actually evidenced by the data?
- Cash Forecast: are timing assumptions too optimistic?
- Board Deck: is the narrative stronger than the numbers support?

### Phase 1: Spec Lock

Purpose:

- agree on the actual decision or story specification
- capture flip criteria
- move to `PROVISIONAL_LOCK` only when the session is defensible

Examples:

- Variance Studio: lock the top 3 drivers and recommendation set
- Cash Forecast: lock methodology, scenario thresholds, and alert rules
- Board Generator: lock the storyline, KPI set, and risks before slide generation

### Phase 2: Validation

Purpose:

- validate implementation or final artifact quality
- require third-party confirmation before `LOCKED`

Examples:

- Board Generator: third-party review of narrative and numbers before issue
- Investment Tool: challenge the scoring and recommendation before committee use
- AP Optimizer: validate that payout ranking respects policy and constraints

## Implementation Guidance

Use a shared architecture across the roadmap:

- `cme/chp/` for hardening logic, gates, registry, packets, and validations
- `cme/finance/` for domain adapters
- `Excel` skill for workbook-backed workflows
- `PowerPoint` skill for board deck generation

This keeps CHP as the durable substrate instead of a one-off feature inside each app.

## Immediate Recommendation

Implement next in this order:

1. Monthly CFO Variance Studio
2. 13-Week Cash Forecast Engine
3. Board Reporting Generator

These three maximize speed, usefulness, and visible differentiation.
